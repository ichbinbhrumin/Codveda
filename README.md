# Codveda Internship Projects 🚀

Welcome to my **Codveda Technology Internship** repository!  
This repo contains the tasks I completed as part of my internship at **Codveda Technology**, where I worked on real-world projects in Data Science and Machine Learning.

## 📂 Project Tasks

### 🔹 Level 1: Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and explored datasets.
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and transformations.
- Generated meaningful insights using **Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib**.

---

### 🔹 Level 2: Machine Learning Models
#### 2.1: Classification Task  
- Implemented **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**.  
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Exported results to CSV.  

#### 2.3: Clustering Task  
- Applied **KMeans clustering** on text quotes.  
- Evaluated clusters using **Silhouette Score**.  
- Example cluster output: grouped quotes with similar themes.

### 🔹 Level 3: Advanced Tasks
#### 3.1: Time Series Analysis  
- Decomposed time series into **trend, seasonality, and residuals**.  
- Applied **Moving Average** and **Exponential Smoothing**.  
- Built **ARIMA model** for forecasting.  
- Achieved RMSE ~6.7.  

#### 3.2: NLP - Text Classification  
- Preprocessed quotes dataset (**tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization**).  
- Converted text to **TF-IDF vectors**.  
- Trained **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**.  
- Cross-validated results and saved predictions.  

#### 3.3: Neural Networks with TensorFlow/Keras  
- Built a **Feed-Forward Neural Network** for classification.  
- Evaluated performance using accuracy and loss curves.  
- Tuned hyperparameters for better results.
